# Github I hate your recommendations

## allow me to not see them

I personally hate the github suggestion of people I would like to follow, and there is currently no way to hide it. Now way to mark - I hate (do not like) your recommendation show me someone else or no one at all.


Until github add this feature I am using this script to hide those elements from my feed.


## Install

Copy paste this script to the firefox/chrome extension tampermonkey.
